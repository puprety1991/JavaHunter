Classes and Objects?
--> A class is a template/Blueprint from which we create the objects.
--> An object in programming is very similar to the object that we have in real life.
    Object:
           --> Object have states that defines how the object look like.
               We define the states with the help of Attributes/Properties/fields inside a Class.
               Objects can also have behaviors(Thing that object can do). We use methods to define
               these behaviors.

ArrayList vs LinkedList:
    ArrayList and LinkedList both implements the list interface. But internal implementation is different.
    LinkedList is better for manipulation (adding new data at run time in-between or in the start of the list or removing data)
    of data. ArrayList is better when most of the time we use get method.
Sets:
    Sets are another set of datastructures in collections framework that allows us to store only unique data.
    As we can covert any data structure in collections framework we can use sets to remove duplicate data
    from List we can also use Sets.
Types of Sets:
    There are many types of Sets, but we will be discussing only 1) HasSet 2) LinkedHashSet 3) TreeSet
HasSet:
        DownSide:HasSet does not maintain the insertion order.
        UpSide: It is most memory efficient and it requires less space as compared to other types of sets.
LinkedHasSet:
        Upside: order of the elements is maintained.
        DownSide: It take more memory, and it is slower than HashSet
TreeSet:
        UpSide: Data is sorted in natural order
        DownSide: it is slowest, and it takes more memory than HashSet.
Important interview Question:
What is toString() method?
    -> toString method is used to print instance fields of a class whenever we try to print the object of a class.
       Method internally calls this method. This method is inherited from the object class. All the classes that we create
       in java automatically

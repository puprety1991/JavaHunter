Exception Handling:
    Exceptions are unwanted behaviours which occurs during runtime and can terminate programs or can change the
    normal behaviour of a program.
Why should we handle exceptions?
    1) When we handle exceptions it leads to a very good user experience.
    2) We can read the error messages and can figure what we are doing wrong.
    3) When we handle the exceptions properly only the problematic code will not execute rest of the code will still
       continue to work.

File handling in java:
What are files?
    -->  Files are mechanism that help us to store  data permanently on our computer.
Why we should use fil instead of putting the data with code?
    --> Every time when we make to change, we don't need to redeploy and recompile the code.
Steps involved in the compiling and deploying the code.
server => Computer that are up all the time they are sam as our normal laptop/computer with very good hardware.
    1) Developers develop code on development server perform unit testing and they deploy this code to QA servers.
    2) Testers Test the application on the QA serves.
    3) After QA is done they may deploy the code on performance, security testing servers.
    4) Deployment on Staging servers.
    5) Deployment on UAI servers.
    6) Deployment on Production servers.

To avoid all of these processes we create a configuration file and we store the configuration in the file.
this configuration file may contain:
    Usernames, Passwords URLs to database other information for configuration

Collection Framework:
    Collection framework is collection of multiple classes and interface which help us process
    the data efficiently and easily.
Why we should learn about it?
    1) Its very flexible
    20 Provide ready-made methods that we can just use.
What is the Syntax?
    It's similar how we create the object of any class but we used <> to specify the name of the class
    whose objects we are going to store in that class.
Issues with Collections framework:
    1) Collections framework does not work with primitive datatype (solution is use wrapper classes).

Note: Frequently asked in interviews!!!!!
Wrapper classes:
    Wrapper classes are object types for all all primitive types.
Boxing:
    Converting the primitive data type to its corresponding wrapper type by explicitly calling a method.
       //  Integer wrapperNum = Integer.valueOf(num); / //boxing or manual conversion from primitive to wrapper type
Auto Boxing:
    Converting the primitive data type to its corresponding wrapper type by simply assigning the values.
        int num=10
        Integer wrapperNum = num;
Unboxing:
    Converting wrapper to its corresponding primitive type by explicitly calling method a method.
      int num2 = wrapperNum.intValue()
Auto-unboxing:
    Converting wrapper to its corresponding primitive data type by simply assigning the value
        int num2 = wrapperNum

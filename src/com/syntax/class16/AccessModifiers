Access Modifiers:
    Access modifiers are keywords which control the access of fields or methods or the class itself.
    There are 4 access level and 3 access modifiers keywords. These are only applicable to instance or static variables
    not to local variables.
Private access Modifier:
        It is the most restriction one. if we use private keyword with any variable or method.
        We can only access it within the same class.
When we should use private access modifier:
        We should always try to create variables as private.
Advantage:--> The data that we store inside the private variables is secured.

Default access Modifier:
        Default is not a keyword, whenever we don't assign any access modifier keyword like private or public. Java
        assigns default access level to those variables or methods.
        The variables or method which has default access level can be access withing the same class  or in any other
        class that is present inside the same package.

Public access Modifiers:
        Public access is the most unrestricted modifier. Once used with the variable or method we can access that
        variable or method anywhere in our project.

Note:
    We can have only one public class in a file and the name o that class

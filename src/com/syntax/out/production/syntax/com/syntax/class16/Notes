Types of variables in java with respect to their scope:
    There are three types of variables in java with respect to their
    scope. Local instance and static.
Local variables:
    If a variable is declared inside a block of code like method, loop,
    if-condition they are called local variables.
Up-Side of a local variable:
    The upside is they exist for a very short amount of time in the memory.
    which means other programs on our computer can use that memory.
Down-Side of local variables:
    Their scope is very limited. only inside that block in which they are created.
    we can't access them outside that block.
When to use:
    We should always try to use local variable over instance variables whenever it
    is possible.
Instance variables:
    The variables which are declared inside a class but outside of block of code are called
    instance variables.
Up-side:
    We can use these variables inside any block of code that is inside that class.

DownSide:
    They occupy the memory for longer than a local variable.
When we should use instance variables:
    1) When we need to share a value between two or more methods then we should go with the instance variable.
    2) When we are planing to create multiple objects of a class and it is possible that all the objects can have
    a different value for that variable.
static variable:
    An instance variable with static keyword is called a static variable.
Up-side:
    We can share data across the objects with the help of static variable.
Down-side:
    They occupy the memory for the longest period.
When to use:
    When we want to share something across all the methods.

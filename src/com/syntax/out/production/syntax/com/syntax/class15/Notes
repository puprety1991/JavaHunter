Why we should exclude packages and class from compiling:
    In intellij if we have a syntax error in any of the file in a project we can't run
    another file unless and until we fix that error. some time we want to execute
    code in some files without fixing those issue this is where we should exc

How to Exclude packages:
    Double-click the shift button twice quickly and type excludes and hit enter
    from the pop-up window click on the plus button and select the packages that you
    want to exclude.

How Java code is compiled/executed on a computer:
    We write the code in files with extension .java
    once we hit the run button a software program called compiler checks this code for errors
    and convert it to byte code. usually stored in a folder called bin/out.
    JVM another software further converts this code to binary code and this binary code
    is what is excluded on your computers.

Methods in Java:
    Method is a block of code or some java statements grouped together.

Why we should learn about the method:
    Methods help us reduce the amount of code that we have to write. For eg. if a piece of code
    is being repeated. we can crete a method for it and simple call the method. whenever we need that logic again.

Syntax of creating method:
    we cab create methods only inside a class.
    [datatype] [method name][(datatype variableName)][method body]
    [datatype] can be void boolean String int etc.
    [method name] they are like variable names;
    [(datatype variableName)] used to pass data while calling method

How do we decide that we should use void or a method with a return keyword.
    if we are building a method that will be used by others or in other parts of your code which
    require some data from your method like an if condition we should not create methods with void type.

Types of variable with respect to their score:
    There are three types of variables w.r.t their scope.
    1) local variable.
    2) instance variable.
    3) static variables.
Local variables:
    A variables that is created inside a method, loop, switch case, or any block of code is called
    local variables.For eg.
                           for(int i=0; i<5;i++){
                           System.out.println(i) // 'i' is local variable
                           }
Why we should use local variables:
    Local variables occupied computers memory for the shortest amount of time. We should always go with Local variables
    if that is possibles.
Instance variables:
    Instance variables that is declared outside of block of code but inside a class are called instance variables.
When we should use instance variables:
    when we are planning to create multiple objects of a class or we want to share something in multiple methods we
    should go with instance variables. They occupied the memory for longer as compare to local variables.
Static variables:
    if an instance variable has a keyword static is called a static variable.
When we should use Static variables:
    when we need to share something across the object. we use static variables but it occupies it memory for the longer
    time.

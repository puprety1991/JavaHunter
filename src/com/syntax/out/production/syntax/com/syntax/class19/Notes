    Inheritance is a mechanism in java through which we can use the fields/methods of
    one class inside another class.
    There are 4 types of inheritance.
    1) Single inheritance:
        In single inheritance we have only one parent and one child class.
        Employee->Person.
    2) Multilevel Inheritance:
        In Multilevel inheritance we have inheritance in multiple levels like we have a grandfather-> father->son->grand son
    3) Hierarchical inheritance:
       one parent class and multiple direct child classes.
    4) Multiple inheritance:
        one child class can directly inherit from multiple parent classes. it is not supported by java because of diamond problem.
Why should we learn inheritance?
    It allows to reduce the duplicate code.
what is the syntax?
    we can use this feature by writing extends keyword when declaring a class.


Note:
    if we are in same class so we can do --> this(dataType var1, dataType var2);
    if we want to refer to the parents class so we can do --> super(dataType var1, dataType var2);

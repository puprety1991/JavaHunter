What is inheritance?
    It's mechanism through which a class can inherit the properties and methods of another class.
Why we should learn inheritance?
    -   It helps us to avoid code duplication.
    -   It helps us to save space.
    -   It helps us to improve the execution speed.
What is the syntax?
    We use the extends keyword and the name of the class from we want to inherit the fields and method while
    declaring the class.
Types of inheritance:
    There can be 4 types of inheritance but java only supports 3 of them with classes.
    1) Single Inheritance.
    2) Multilevel Inheritance.
    3) Hierarchical Inheritance
    4) Multiple Inheritance (Not supported by classes in Java).
Single Inheritance:
    When we have only one parent and one child class in Inheritance, it is called single Inheritance (Not widely Used).
Multilevel Inheritance:
    One top Leve and one base class and many intermediate Classes.For eg. A>B>C>D...
Hierarchical Inheritance:
    When we have one parent class and multiple child classes called Hierarchical Inheritance.
Multiple Inheritance:
    One child and multiple parent classes. It is not supported by classes in Java. It creates the diamond problem.

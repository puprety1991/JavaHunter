Type Casting(Primitive):
    Type casting is converting one data type to another one.
    example: we can covert a short to byte,  a long to float etc.
    There are two two main types implicit/widening/automatic and explicit/narrowing/Manual

Implicit/Widening/Automatic:
    When java converts the data type automatically for us. It only happens when we assign
    a smaller data type to a larger data type. because there is no data loss in this conversion.    

Explicit/Narrowing/Manual Type casting:
	When we convert a larger data type to a smaller data type. It is called Explicit/Narrowing/Manual.
	It does not happen automatically we have to do it explicitly manually. 
	
Why we should learn type casting?
	When we write code in our real life most of the time we use the code from others to save time and we might
	also need to covert the data types to make our code compatible with their code.
	
What is the syntax for type casting?
	When use() and inside the () we write the destination data types for example
	if we want convert a long to an int this is how we can do it.
	
	long var =1234;
	int var2 = (int) var; //its Explicit/narrowing/Manual
	double var3 = var2; //Implicit/widening/automatic

If else conditions
	If else conditions help us write code that can take the decision based on data.
Why we should learn about if else?
	Because when we are solving a real life problem like  testing a web site our program needs to make a lot of decisions.
	IF (the giver username and password matches)
	 {go to home page} ELSE {give user a warning}
	 
	 if(video freezing){
	 System.out.println("Stop video");
	 }else{System.out.println("Keep Video");
	 }
What is the syntax for If else conditions
	boolean isHungry = true;
	if(isHungry){
	System.out.println("Please Eat something");
	
	}else{
	System.out.println("Lets build some java program");
	}

HashTable:
    HashTable is previous version of HashMap. Hashtable is thread safe. It uses synchronization to achieve
    thread safety and because of this it is slow as compared to hashMap.
Why we should not use Hashtable.
    As a Tester its very rare that we will be writing multithreaded code and if don't write multithreaded
    code but still use HashTable it will make our code slow for no benefit.
Difference between HashMap and HashTable:
    HashTable is thread safe while hashMap is not.

Maps:
    How can we iterate through a map

Important concepts for your coding tests:
    - if else condition
    - loops
    - array
    - String class method
    - ArrayList
    - Maps

Important concept for verbal interview:
    - OOPS

For Frameworks:
    1) How classes work for example how to create a class, how to delcare a instance variables, how to use them inside
       methods.
    2) Go through all the concepts of methods
    3) Types of variables like instance static(you will be using heavily)
    4) Inheritance
    5) ArrayList and Maps

FileHandling in Java:
    Reading writing and manipulating files.

Why we should learn about file handling?
    -> We don't store senstive data inside the code it might get exposed when we push the code to github.

Collection framework:
    --> Is a set of classes and interfaces that help use store and manipulate data.
Why we need collections framework?
    1) Flexibility
    2) Ready made methods
    3) Same classes and methods can be used with different datatype.
Some common classes:
    1) ArrayList
    2) LinkedList
    3) HasSet
    4) LinkedHasSet
    5) TreeSet
Some common interfaces:
    1) List
    2) Set
List:
    --> Lists like ArrayList and LinkedList maintains the insertion order.
    --> They allow duplicates.
Set:
    --> They do not allow duplicate values.
ArrayList Vs LinkedList:
    --> When most of the time we retrieve the data(get()) we should use ArrayList. As it is faster
        to retrieve index based date as underlying datastructures is an array.
    --> When most of the time we manipulate data(adding,removing, shifting(add(),remove())).
Note for coding interview:
    --> if else condition/loops/arrays/String class/maps/ArrayList
HashSet Vs LinkedHashSet Vs TresSet:
    --> HashSet: We should always go with the HashSet because it is fastest of all and requires less memory.
    --> LinkedHashSet: If order is important like for example when we go KFC the customers who order first should
                       be processed first we should use.
    --> TreeSet: If we are working on applications that requires us to sort data like phonebooks or dictionaries
                 we should use.
Maps:
    --> Whenever we have to store key value pairs for example, items and their prices we should use.
